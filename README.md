# Calculator-App
The Basic Calculator project is a Java-based application designed to simulate a simple calculator with a graphical user interface (GUI). The application performs basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.


# Basic Calculator in Java

## Overview

This project is a **Basic Calculator** built using Java's Swing library for GUI. It provides a graphical user interface (GUI) to perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The calculator also supports additional functionalities like negation, clearing the display, and deleting the last input.

## Features

- **Basic Operations**: Add, Subtract, Multiply, Divide.
- **Additional Functionalities**:
  - Decimal point input.
  - Negate numbers.
  - Delete the last character.
  - Clear the entire input.
- **Graphical Interface**: Built using Java's `JFrame` and `JPanel`.

## Technologies Used

- **Programming Language**: Java
- **GUI Library**: Swing
- **Event Handling**: Java AWT (`ActionListener` interface)

## How to Run

1. **Prerequisites**:
   - Ensure you have Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your machine.
   - Use an IDE such as IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or any text editor with support for Java.

2. **Steps**:
   - Copy the source code into a file named `Calculator.java`.
   - Compile the program:
     ```bash
     javac Calculator.java
     ```
   - Run the program:
     ```bash
     java Calculator
     ```

3. A window will appear displaying the calculator interface.

## Usage

1. Use the number buttons (`0-9`) to input values.
2. Select operation buttons (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`) to perform arithmetic operations.
3. Use the `=` button to calculate the result.
4. Additional buttons:
   - `.`: Input a decimal point.
   - `Clr`: Clear the display.
   - `Del`: Delete the last character.
   - `(-)`: Negate the current number.

## Future Enhancements

- Add support for advanced mathematical operations (e.g., square root, power).
- Improve UI aesthetics.
- Implement keyboard input for better usability.
